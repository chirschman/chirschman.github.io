I'm Caelyn, a biomechanics researcher completing my PhD in Dr. Alena Grabowski's Applied Biomechanics Lab at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am passionate about assistive devices, footwear and product development. My PhD work has been focused on using biofeedback to aid with gait retraining in somebody with an amputation, applying the mechanics of biological legs when running on slopes to future assistive device design and investigating how female specific soccer cleats effect performance of female soccer players compared to when they wear men’s cleats.

My Work and Research
======
My master’s work was focused on quantifying the mechanics of the biological leg when running on uphill and downhill slopes to apply to future assistive device design. Athletes with a unilateral trans-tibial amputation use a running specific (RSP) prosthesis to run. These devices are designed to mimic the mechanics of the biological leg when running on level ground. The mechanics of the biological leg have yet to be explored when running on slopes and could be beneficial when designing a versatile RSP. We quantified joint stiffness of the ankle and knee and used a novel equation to calculate how the ankle and knee contributions to overall leg stiffness change on slopes compared to level ground. To see what we found, see the publications tab!

My PhD work has been focused on investigating how real-time visual feedback of peak propulsive force effects the biomechanics and energetics of an individual with a unilateral trans-tibial amputation when using an Energy Storage and Return (ESAR) prosthesis compared to the BiOM powered ankle-foot prosthesis. With mixed results in the literature regarding whether the BiOM can normalize biomechanical compensations and elevated metabolic cost that we see in this population, further investigations are needed to see whether training can help individuals utilize the push-off power provided by the BiOM. Stay tuned to see what we find out about this!

A PhD wouldn't be complete with a handful of side projects. I have helped Specialized test their 3D printed saddles and attempted to improve the repeatability of EMG electrode placement. I have also helped out with a project that is comparing the gold standard method of motion capture to IMU's when measuring the angle changes that occur when a prosthetist changes the alignment of a prosthesis. I am also interested in how female specific soccer cleats effect performance of female soccer players compared to when they wear men’s cleats.
